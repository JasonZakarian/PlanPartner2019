# PlanPartner 2019

<p>The newest code I can post from my current freelance position.  As it is from a web app still in development there is no live site I can link to, but there are screenshots available to give you a good idea of the end product.  There is also older code from our initial build if you'd like to see work I did with basic forms (Login,Register), as well as some data intensive sales tracking and metric creation. Languages/Frameworks used: Reactjs, Javascript, C#, T-SQL.  Thank you for your interest!</p>
